# Imbalanced Dataset Practice using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding and practicing **Machine Learning techniques on imbalanced datasets**, a very common challenge in real-world applications such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, spam detection, and churn prediction.<br>
The notebook demonstrates how class imbalance affects model training and evaluation.<br>

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
To analyze and train a machine learning model on an **imbalanced dataset** and understand why standard evaluation metrics like accuracy may be misleading.<br>

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
- The dataset contains **imbalanced class distribution**<br>
- One class significantly outnumbers the other<br>
- Represents real-world scenarios where rare events are important<br>

**Target Variable:**
- Majority Class<br>
- Minority Class<br>

---

## ⚠️ Important Concept: Imbalanced Data
In imbalanced datasets:<br>
- Models tend to favor the majority class<br>
- High accuracy does not always indicate good performance<br>
- Minority class prediction becomes challenging<br>

This project highlights these challenges clearly.<br>
